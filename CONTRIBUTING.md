Thank you for considering contributing to Alfredo!

We use Docker in development. 

First, you need to have Docker installed in your machine. 
Then, you can run the following command to build the base image:
```
npm run build
```

After that, you can run the following command to start the development environment:
```
npm run bash
```

## Maintainers only

Build the base image workflow, manually dispatch from the GH cli.
```
npm run build-base-image-workflow
```
